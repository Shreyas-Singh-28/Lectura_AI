 Here's 5 chess rules you didn't know. In chess you can win and lose, but you can also draw. The most common type is like this. You offer a draw, the opponent accepts. But did you know there's 5 other ways you can tie in chess? Number 1 is perpetual check. Your king is stuck in a vortex and anywhere he moves, it's a series of endless checks. The game is a draw. Number 2 is the threefold repetition. You repeat the exact same position 3 times. This can happen in a row or just in the same game. Number 3, the 50 move rule. No pawns advance and no pieces get captured for 50 turns. Nobody can make progress so the game is a draw. Number 4. Mission checkmaiding material. There is not enough material on the board to force a checkmate. Number 5.
